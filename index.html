        <p>Test to voerflow Like tables, grid layout allows us to align
           components into columns and rows. However, numerous layouts
           are either achievable or easier with CSS grid than they were
            with tables. For example, a grid container’s children could
            place themselves so they truly overlap and layer, alike CSS
            positioned elements.

        <p>This is a site to capture my learnings in HTML and CSS as I progress
           in my journey to learn about coding. My intention is to distill my
           findings into reusable code for future projects. I hope that it
           becomes a useful resource for myself and others.
